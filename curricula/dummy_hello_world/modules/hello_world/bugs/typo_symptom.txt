# Bug Symptom: Typo in Greeting Message

## Observed Behavior
Your implementation now returns a greeting with a typo: "Hello, Mastery Enginne!" instead of the expected "Hello, Mastery Engine!".

## Your Challenge
Debug and fix the typo in your `hello_world.py` file.

## Expected Output
After your fix, the function should return:
```
Hello, Mastery Engine!
```

## Debugging Tips
- Carefully review your `greet()` function
- Check the spelling of each word in the return statement
- Run the validator to confirm your fix: `engine submit-fix`

This is a simple example bug to demonstrate the Harden stage workflow. In real curriculum modules, bugs would test deeper understanding of edge cases, algorithm correctness, and system behavior.
