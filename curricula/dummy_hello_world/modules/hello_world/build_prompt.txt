# Build Challenge: Hello World

## Objective
Create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, Mastery Engine!" to the console.

## Requirements
Create a file at `workspace/hello_world.py` that:
1. Contains a function `greet()` that returns the string "Hello, Mastery Engine!"
2. When run as a script, prints the greeting to stdout

## Expected Output
```
Hello, Mastery Engine!
```

## Submission
Once you've implemented the solution, run:
```bash
engine --submit-build
```

This is a minimal example to validate the Mastery Engine architecture. In real curriculum modules, this would be a substantial engineering challenge.
