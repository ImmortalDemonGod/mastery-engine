# Build Challenge: Subsets

## Pattern Overview

> Backtracking is an algorithmic technique that incrementally builds a solution by trying options, abandoning paths that fail, and returning to try alternatives.

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` of **unique** elements, return all possible subsets (the power set).
The solution set **must not** contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in **any order**.
 
**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3]
**Output:** [[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** nums = [0]
**Output:** [[],[0]]

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10`
- `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
- All the numbers of `nums` are **unique**.

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Acceptance Rate:** 81.7%  
**Topics:** Array, Backtracking, Bit Manipulation

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution
