# Build Challenge: Climbing Stairs

## Pattern Overview

> Dynamic programming solves complex problems by breaking them into simpler subproblems, storing solutions to avoid redundant calculations.

## Problem Statement

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
 
**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** n = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 45`

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Acceptance Rate:** 53.8%  
**Topics:** Math, Dynamic Programming, Memoization

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution


## Hints

If you're stuck, consider these hints:


1. To reach nth step, what could have been your previous steps? (Think about the step sizes)
