# Build Challenge: Sort List

## Pattern Overview

> Divide and conquer is an algorithmic paradigm that breaks a problem into smaller subproblems, solves them independently, and then combines their solutions to solve the original problem, often enabling efficient solutions through recursion.

## Problem Statement

Given the `head` of a linked list, return the list after sorting it in **ascending order**.
 
**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** head = [4,2,1,3]
**Output:** [1,2,3,4]

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
**Output:** [-1,0,3,4,5]

```

**Example 3:**

```

**Input:** head = []
**Output:** []

```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 5 * 104]`.
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`

**Follow up:** Can you sort the linked list in `O(n logn)` time and `O(1)` memory (i.e. constant space)?

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Acceptance Rate:** 63.2%  
**Topics:** Linked List, Two Pointers, Divide and Conquer, Sorting, Merge Sort

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution
