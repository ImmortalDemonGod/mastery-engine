# Build Challenge: Binary Search

## Pattern Overview

> Binary search efficiently finds elements in sorted data by repeatedly dividing the search space in half, achieving O(log n) time complexity.

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.
You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.
 
**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** 2 does not exist in nums so return -1

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-104 < nums[i], target < 104`
- All the integers in `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is sorted in ascending order.

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Acceptance Rate:** 60.1%  
**Topics:** Array, Binary Search

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution
