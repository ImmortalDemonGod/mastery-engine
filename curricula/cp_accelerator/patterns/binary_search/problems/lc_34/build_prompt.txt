# Build Challenge: Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

## Pattern Overview

> Binary search efficiently finds elements in sorted data by repeatedly dividing the search space in half, achieving O(log n) time complexity.

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given `target` value.
If `target` is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.
You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.
 
**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
**Output:** [3,4]

```
**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
**Output:** [-1,-1]

```
**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** nums = [], target = 0
**Output:** [-1,-1]

```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `nums` is a non-decreasing array.
- `-109 <= target <= 109`

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Acceptance Rate:** 47.8%  
**Topics:** Array, Binary Search

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution
