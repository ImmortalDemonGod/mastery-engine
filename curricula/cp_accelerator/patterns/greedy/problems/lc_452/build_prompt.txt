# Build Challenge: Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

## Pattern Overview

> Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum, often providing efficient solutions for optimization problems.

## Problem Statement

There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [xstart, xend]` denotes a balloon whose **horizontal diameter** stretches between `xstart` and `xend`. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.
Arrows can be shot up **directly vertically** (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with `xstart` and `xend` is **burst** by an arrow shot at `x` if `xstart <= x <= xend`. There is **no limit** to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.
Given the array `points`, return the **minimum** number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.
 
**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.

```

**Example 3:**

```

**Input:** points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= points.length <= 105`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `-231 <= xstart < xend <= 231 - 1`

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Acceptance Rate:** 60.9%  
**Topics:** Array, Greedy, Sorting

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution
