# Build Challenge: Non-overlapping Intervals

## Pattern Overview

> Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum, often providing efficient solutions for optimization problems.

## Problem Statement

Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
**Note** that intervals which only touch at a point are **non-overlapping**. For example, `[1, 2]` and `[2, 3]` are non-overlapping.
 
**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

```

**Example 3:**

```

**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 105`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `-5 * 104 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104`

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Acceptance Rate:** 56.3%  
**Topics:** Array, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Sorting

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution
