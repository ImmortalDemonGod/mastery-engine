# Build Challenge: Kth Largest Element in an Array

## Pattern Overview

> Heaps are specialized tree-based data structures that satisfy the heap property, making them efficient for finding minimum or maximum elements. Priority queues are abstract data types typically implemented with heaps.

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `kth` largest element in the array.
Note that it is the `kth` largest element in the sorted order, not the `kth` distinct element.
Can you solve it without sorting?
 
**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
**Output:** 5

```
**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
**Output:** 4

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Acceptance Rate:** 68.6%  
**Topics:** Array, Divide and Conquer, Sorting, Heap (Priority Queue), Quickselect

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution
