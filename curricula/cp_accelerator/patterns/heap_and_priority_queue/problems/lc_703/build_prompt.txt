# Build Challenge: Kth Largest Element in a Stream

## Pattern Overview

> Heaps are specialized tree-based data structures that satisfy the heap property, making them efficient for finding minimum or maximum elements. Priority queues are abstract data types typically implemented with heaps.

## Problem Statement

You are part of a university admissions office and need to keep track of the `kth` highest test score from applicants in real-time. This helps to determine cut-off marks for interviews and admissions dynamically as new applicants submit their scores.
You are tasked to implement a class which, for a given integer `k`, maintains a stream of test scores and continuously returns the `k`th highest test score **after** a new score has been submitted. More specifically, we are looking for the `k`th highest score in the sorted list of all scores.
Implement the `KthLargest` class:

- `KthLargest(int k, int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer `k` and the stream of test scores `nums`.
- `int add(int val)` Adds a new test score `val` to the stream and returns the element representing the `kth` largest element in the pool of test scores so far.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**
["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add", "add"]
[[3, [4, 5, 8, 2]], [3], [5], [10], [9], [4]]
**Output:** [null, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8]
**Explanation:**
KthLargest kthLargest = new KthLargest(3, [4, 5, 8, 2]);
kthLargest.add(3); // return 4
kthLargest.add(5); // return 5
kthLargest.add(10); // return 5
kthLargest.add(9); // return 8
kthLargest.add(4); // return 8

**Example 2:**

**Input:**
["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add"]
[[4, [7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 3]], [2], [10], [9], [9]]
**Output:** [null, 7, 7, 7, 8]
**Explanation:**
KthLargest kthLargest = new KthLargest(4, [7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 3]);
kthLargest.add(2); // return 7
kthLargest.add(10); // return 7
kthLargest.add(9); // return 7
kthLargest.add(9); // return 8
 
**Constraints:**

- `0 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length + 1`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `-104 <= val <= 104`
- At most `104` calls will be made to `add`.

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution
