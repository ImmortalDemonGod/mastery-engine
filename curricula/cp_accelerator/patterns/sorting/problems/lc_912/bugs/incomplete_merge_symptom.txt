Wrong Answer on Test 2

Expected: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 5]
Got: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]

Symptom: Your sorted array is missing elements. The output is shorter than the input.

This happens when the merge function doesn't properly combine all elements
from both subarrays. One of the arrays still has remaining elements that
never get added to the result.

Debug hint: After the main while loop in merge(), what happens to leftover 
elements in either array?
