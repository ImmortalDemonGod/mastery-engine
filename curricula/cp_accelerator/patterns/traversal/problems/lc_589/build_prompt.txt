# Build Challenge: N-ary Tree Preorder Traversal

## Pattern Overview

> Traversal algorithms systematically visit all elements in a data structure, using different strategies based on the structure and problem requirements.

## Problem Statement

Given the `root` of an n-ary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.
Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal. Each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples)
 
**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
**Output:** [1,3,5,6,2,4]

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
**Output:** [1,2,3,6,7,11,14,4,8,12,5,9,13,10]

```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 104`
- The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`.

**Follow up:** Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Acceptance Rate:** 76.5%  
**Topics:** Stack, Tree, Depth-First Search

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-preorder-traversal/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution
