# Build Challenge: Remove Linked List Elements

## Pattern Overview

> Linked lists are dynamic data structures that excel at insertion and deletion operations, forming the foundation for many advanced data structures and algorithms.

## Problem Statement

Given the `head` of a linked list and an integer `val`, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has `Node.val == val`, and return the new head.
 
**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6], val = 6
**Output:** [1,2,3,4,5]

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** head = [], val = 1
**Output:** []

```

**Example 3:**

```

**Input:** head = [7,7,7,7], val = 7
**Output:** []

```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 50`
- `0 <= val <= 50`

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Acceptance Rate:** 53.2%  
**Topics:** Linked List, Recursion

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-linked-list-elements/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution
