# Build Challenge: Contains Duplicate II

## Pattern Overview

> Hash tables provide O(1) average-case lookup, insertion, and deletion operations, making them essential for problems requiring fast access to stored data.

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` if there are two **distinct indices** `i` and `j` in the array such that `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `abs(i - j) <= k`.
 
**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
**Output:** true

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1
**Output:** true

```

**Example 3:**

```

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2
**Output:** false

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `0 <= k <= 105`

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Acceptance Rate:** 50.1%  
**Topics:** Array, Hash Table, Sliding Window

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate-ii/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution
