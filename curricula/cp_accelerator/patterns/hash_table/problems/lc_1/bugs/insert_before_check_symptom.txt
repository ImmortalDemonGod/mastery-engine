Wrong Answer on Test 3

Input: nums = [3, 3], target = 6
Expected: [0, 1]
Got: [0, 0]

Symptom: Your solution returns the same index twice instead of two different indices.

This happens when you check if the complement exists in your hash table AFTER 
inserting the current element. When nums[i] * 2 equals the target, the complement
equals the current element, and you incorrectly find it at the same index.

Example walkthrough for the bug:
- i = 0, nums[0] = 3, target = 6
- Insert: seen[3] = 0
- Compute complement: 6 - 3 = 3
- Check: 3 in seen? YES, at index 0
- Return [0, 0]  ← WRONG! This uses the same element twice

Debug hint: Should you check for the complement BEFORE or AFTER inserting the 
current element into the hash table? Think about what happens when the complement
equals the current number.
