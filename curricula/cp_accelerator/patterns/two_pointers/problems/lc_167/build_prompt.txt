# Build Challenge: Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

## Pattern Overview

> Two pointers is a technique that uses multiple pointers to solve array or linked list problems efficiently, typically reducing time complexity from O(n²) to O(n).

## Problem Statement

Given a **1-indexed** array of integers `numbers` that is already **sorted in non-decreasing order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.
Return the indices of the two numbers, `index1` and `index2`, **added by one** as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length 2.
The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**. You **may not** use the same element twice.
Your solution must use only constant extra space.
 
**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
**Output:** [1,2]
**Explanation:** The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
**Output:** [1,3]
**Explanation:** The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].

```

**Example 3:**

```

**Input:** numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
**Output:** [1,2]
**Explanation:** The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104`
- `-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000`
- `numbers` is sorted in **non-decreasing order**.
- `-1000 <= target <= 1000`
- The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**.

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii---input-array-is-sorted/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution
