# Build Challenge: Two Sum Less Than K

## Pattern Overview

> Two pointers is a technique that uses multiple pointers to solve array or linked list problems efficiently, typically reducing time complexity from O(n²) to O(n).

## Problem Statement



**Difficulty:** Unknown | **Acceptance Rate:** N/A  
**Topics:** General

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-less-than-k/





## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-less-than-k/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution
