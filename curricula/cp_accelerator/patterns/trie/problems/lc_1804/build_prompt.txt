# Build Challenge: Implement Trie II (Prefix Tree)

## Pattern Overview

> Tries (prefix trees) are tree-like data structures used to store associative arrays where keys are usually strings, optimizing search operations for string-related problems.

## Problem Statement



**Difficulty:** Unknown | **Acceptance Rate:** N/A  
**Topics:** General

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-ii-prefix-tree/





## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-ii-prefix-tree/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution
