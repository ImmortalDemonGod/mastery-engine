# Build Challenge: Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)

## Pattern Overview

> Tries (prefix trees) are tree-like data structures used to store associative arrays where keys are usually strings, optimizing search operations for string-related problems.

## Problem Statement

A **trie** (pronounced as "try") or **prefix tree** is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.
Implement the Trie class:

- `Trie()` Initializes the trie object.
- `void insert(String word)` Inserts the string `word` into the trie.
- `boolean search(String word)` Returns `true` if the string `word` is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and `false` otherwise.
- `boolean startsWith(String prefix)` Returns `true` if there is a previously inserted string `word` that has the prefix `prefix`, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

```

**Input**
["Trie", "insert", "search", "search", "startsWith", "insert", "search"]
[[], ["apple"], ["apple"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"]]
**Output**
[null, null, true, false, true, null, true]

**Explanation**
Trie trie = new Trie();
trie.insert("apple");
trie.search("apple"); // return True
trie.search("app"); // return False
trie.startsWith("app"); // return True
trie.insert("app");
trie.search("app"); // return True

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word.length, prefix.length <= 2000`
- `word` and `prefix` consist only of lowercase English letters.
- At most `3 * 104` calls **in total** will be made to `insert`, `search`, and `startsWith`.

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Acceptance Rate:** 68.8%  
**Topics:** Hash Table, String, Design, Trie

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution
