# Build Challenge: Check If Word Is Valid After Substitutions

## Pattern Overview

> Stacks and queues are fundamental data structures that provide controlled access to elements, enabling elegant solutions to problems involving sequential processing, backtracking, and breadth-first exploration.

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, determine if it is **valid**.
A string `s` is **valid** if, starting with an empty string `t = ""`, you can **transform **`t`** into **`s` after performing the following operation **any number of times**:

- Insert string `"abc"` into any position in `t`. More formally, `t` becomes `tleft + "abc" + tright`, where `t == tleft + tright`. Note that `tleft` and `tright` may be **empty**.

Return `true` if `s` is a **valid** string, otherwise, return `false`.
 
**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** s = "aabcbc"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:**
"" -> "abc" -> "aabcbc"
Thus, "aabcbc" is valid.
```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** s = "abcabcababcc"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:**
"" -> "abc" -> "abcabc" -> "abcabcabc" -> "abcabcababcc"
Thus, "abcabcababcc" is valid.

```

**Example 3:**

```

**Input:** s = "abccba"
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** It is impossible to get "abccba" using the operation.

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 2 * 104`
- `s` consists of letters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Acceptance Rate:** 60.7%  
**Topics:** String, Stack

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-word-is-valid-after-substitutions/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution
