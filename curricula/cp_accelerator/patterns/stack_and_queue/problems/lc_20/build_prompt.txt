# Build Challenge: Valid Parentheses

## Pattern Overview

> Stacks and queues are fundamental data structures that provide controlled access to elements, enabling elegant solutions to problems involving sequential processing, backtracking, and breadth-first exploration.

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.
An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "()"
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "()[]{}"
**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "(]"
**Output:** false

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s = "([])"
**Output:** true

**Example 5:**

**Input:** s = "([)]"
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `s` consists of parentheses only `'()[]{}'`.

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Acceptance Rate:** 43.2%  
**Topics:** String, Stack

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution


## Hints

If you're stuck, consider these hints:


1. Use a stack of characters.

2. When you encounter an opening bracket, push it to the top of the stack.

3. When you encounter a closing bracket, check if the top of the stack was the opening for it. If yes, pop it from the stack. Otherwise, return false.
