# Build Challenge: Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero

## Pattern Overview

> Bit manipulation involves directly manipulating the binary representation of numbers using bitwise operations, offering efficient solutions for various computational problems.

## Problem Statement

Given an integer `num`, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero.
In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by `2`, otherwise, you have to subtract `1` from it.
 
**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** num = 14
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** 
Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7. 
Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3. 
Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2. 
Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** num = 8
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** 
Step 1) 8 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 4. 
Step 2) 4 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 2. 
Step 3) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 4) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.

```

**Example 3:**

```

**Input:** num = 123
**Output:** 12

```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= num <= 106`

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Acceptance Rate:** 85.7%  
**Topics:** Math, Bit Manipulation

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-to-zero/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution
