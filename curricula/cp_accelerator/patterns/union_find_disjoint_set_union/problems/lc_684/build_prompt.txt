# Build Challenge: Redundant Connection

## Pattern Overview

> Union Find (Disjoint Set Union) efficiently manages dynamic connectivity in a collection of elements, supporting near-constant time union and find operations.

## Problem Statement

In this problem, a tree is an **undirected graph** that is connected and has no cycles.
You are given a graph that started as a tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two **different** vertices chosen from `1` to `n`, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array `edges` of length `n` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the graph.
Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of `n` nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.
 
**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
**Output:** [2,3]

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
**Output:** [1,4]

```

**Constraints:**

- `n == edges.length`
- `3 <= n <= 1000`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length`
- `ai != bi`
- There are no repeated edges.
- The given graph is connected.

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Acceptance Rate:** 67.0%

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution
