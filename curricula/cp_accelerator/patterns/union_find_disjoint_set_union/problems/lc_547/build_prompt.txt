# Build Challenge: Number of Provinces

## Pattern Overview

> Union Find (Disjoint Set Union) efficiently manages dynamic connectivity in a collection of elements, supporting near-constant time union and find operations.

## Problem Statement

There are `n` cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city `a` is connected directly with city `b`, and city `b` is connected directly with city `c`, then city `a` is connected indirectly with city `c`.
A **province** is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.
You are given an `n x n` matrix `isConnected` where `isConnected[i][j] = 1` if the `ith` city and the `jth` city are directly connected, and `isConnected[i][j] = 0` otherwise.
Return the total number of **provinces**.
 
**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
**Output:** 2

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
**Output:** 3

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 200`
- `n == isConnected.length`
- `n == isConnected[i].length`
- `isConnected[i][j]` is `1` or `0`.
- `isConnected[i][i] == 1`
- `isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]`

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Acceptance Rate:** 69.6%  
**Topics:** Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Union Find, Graph

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution
