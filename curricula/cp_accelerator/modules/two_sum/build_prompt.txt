# Build Challenge: Two Sum

## Pattern Overview

> Hash tables provide O(1) average-case lookup, insertion, and deletion operations, making them essential for problems requiring fast access to stored data.

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.
You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
 
**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
**Output:** [0,1]
**Explanation:** Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
**Output:** [1,2]

```

**Example 3:**

```

**Input:** nums = [3,3], target = 6
**Output:** [0,1]

```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `-109 <= target <= 109`
- **Only one valid answer exists.**

**Follow-up: **Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n2)` time complexity?

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Acceptance Rate:** 56.6%  
**Topics:** Array, Hash Table

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution


## Hints

If you're stuck, consider these hints:


1. A really brute force way would be to search for all possible pairs of numbers but that would be too slow. Again, it's best to try out brute force solutions just for completeness. It is from these brute force solutions that you can come up with optimizations.

2. So, if we fix one of the numbers, say <code>x</code>, we have to scan the entire array to find the next number <code>y</code> which is <code>value - x</code> where value is the input parameter. Can we change our array somehow so that this search becomes faster?

3. The second train of thought is, without changing the array, can we use additional space somehow? Like maybe a hash map to speed up the search?
