# Build Challenge: Number of Islands

## Pattern Overview

> Union Find (Disjoint Set Union) efficiently manages dynamic connectivity in a collection of elements, supporting near-constant time union and find operations.

## Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the number of islands.
An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
 
**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** grid = [
 ["1","1","1","1","0"],
 ["1","1","0","1","0"],
 ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
**Output:** 1

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** grid = [
 ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 ["0","0","1","0","0"],
 ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
**Output:** 3

```

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Acceptance Rate:** 63.3%  
**Topics:** Array, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Union Find, Matrix

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution
