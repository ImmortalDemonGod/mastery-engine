Runtime Error: RecursionError - maximum recursion depth exceeded

Symptom: Your solution crashes on empty arrays with a stack overflow.

The error occurs because when the array is split into [0:0] (empty), 
the base case doesn't catch it, leading to infinite recursion.

Debug hint: What should sortArray([]) return? Update your base case.
