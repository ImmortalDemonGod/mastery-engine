# Build Challenge: Sort an Array

## Pattern Overview

> Sorting algorithms organize data in a specific order, enabling efficient searching, data analysis, and serving as building blocks for more complex algorithms.

## Pattern Taxonomy

## Your Task

Implement a solution to the following problem, which is a canonical example of this pattern.

### Problem: 912. Sort an Array

**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array

**Problem Statement:**
[Note: Visit the problem link above for the complete statement, examples, and constraints]

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Will be provided based on the problem
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution

2. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/

## Common Pitfalls

- Off-by-one errors in pointer movement
- Not handling edge cases (empty arrays, single elements)
- Incorrect termination conditions

## Hints

If you're stuck, consider:
1. Drawing the pointer positions on paper for a small example
2. What invariant should be maintained at each step?
3. What is the termination condition?

## Submission

Once your solution passes local tests:
```bash
engine submit
```
