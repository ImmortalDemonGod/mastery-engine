# Build Challenge: Sort an Array

## Pattern Overview

> Divide and conquer is an algorithmic paradigm that breaks a problem into smaller subproblems, solves them independently, and then combines their solutions to solve the original problem, often enabling efficient solutions through recursion.

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums`, sort the array in ascending order and return it.
You must solve the problem **without using any built-in** functions in `O(nlog(n))` time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.
 
**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** nums = [5,2,3,1]
**Output:** [1,2,3,5]
**Explanation:** After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0]
**Output:** [0,0,1,1,2,5]
**Explanation:** Note that the values of nums are not necessarily unique.

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104`
- `-5 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 104`

**Difficulty:** Medium | **Acceptance Rate:** 56.1%  
**Topics:** Array, Divide and Conquer, Sorting, Heap (Priority Queue), Merge Sort

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution
