ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS (Mastery Engine Architecture):

The following components are original engineering work by ImmortalDemonGod:

- Engine architecture and orchestration (engine/)
- AST mutation system (engine/ast_harden/)
- Shadow worktree management (engine/workspace.py)
- CLI tooling and command interface (engine/main.py)
- LLM validation service with mock mode (engine/services/llm_service.py)
- Curriculum generation pipeline (scripts/)
- Test suite (tests/)
- Build-Justify-Harden pedagogical implementation
- Mock mode fallback system

These components are licensed under the MIT License (see LICENSE file).

SEPARATION OF CONCERNS:

This repository demonstrates a clear separation between:
1. SYSTEM ENGINEERING: The Mastery Engine architecture (original work)
2. EDUCATIONAL CONTENT: Curriculum materials (adapted from cited sources)

The engineering achievement is the creation of a platform that enables:
- Runtime AST-based bug injection
- Shadow worktree process isolation  
- Cost-optimized LLM evaluation
- Automated curriculum generation

The curriculum content serves as demonstration material for these capabilities.
