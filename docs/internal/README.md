# Internal Documentation

This directory contains development artifacts, session logs, and historical documentation that supported the engineering of the Mastery Engine. These files are retained for reference but are not required to understand or use the system.

## Purpose

These documents track the **journey**, not the **product**. They are useful for:
- Understanding design decisions and iterations
- Reviewing test coverage improvements
- Studying the curriculum generation pipeline development
- Historical context for future maintainers

## Structure

### `/archive`
Historical documentation and deprecated materials from earlier iterations.

### `/assignment`
Original course assignment materials (Stanford CS336). Retained for attribution and context.

### `/coverage`
Test coverage reports and baseline measurements across development phases.

### `/current`
Operational guides created during development:
- Bug injection guide
- Curriculum status tracking
- Test coverage reports

### `/development`
Development logs, changelogs, and implementation planning documents:
- MVP completion status
- Worklog entries
- Implementation plans

### `/module_generation`
Comprehensive documentation of the automated curriculum generation pipeline development:
- Phase-by-phase results
- Diagnostic reports
- Refactoring plans

### `/two_sum_qa`
Quality assurance documentation for the two_sum module (first proof-of-concept):
- E2E workflow tests
- Completeness verification
- Module comparison analysis

## For Portfolio Reviewers

**You don't need to read this directory.** 

Instead, see:
- [`/docs/architecture`](../architecture/) - System design and technical architecture
- [`/docs/user-guide`](../user-guide/) - How to use the Mastery Engine
- [`/README.md`](../../README.md) - Quick start and feature overview

This `internal/` directory demonstrates engineering rigor and systematic development practices, but the **architectural docs** are where the engineering insights live.

**Maintained for transparency, not required for understanding.**
