# Build Challenge: {{ problem.title }}

## Pattern Overview

> {{ topic.description if topic.description else "Learn to solve problems using systematic approaches and algorithmic patterns." }}

## Problem Statement

{{ problem.description_formatted }}

**Difficulty:** {{ problem.difficulty }} | **Acceptance Rate:** {{ problem.acceptance_rate }}  
**Topics:** {{ problem.topics|join(', ') if problem.topics else 'General' }}

**Problem Link:** {{ problem.url }}

{% if problem.examples %}
## Examples

{{ problem.examples_formatted }}
{% endif %}

{% if problem.constraints_formatted %}
## Constraints

{{ problem.constraints_formatted }}
{% endif %}

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred language)
2. **File:** `solution.py`
3. **Function Signature:** Derive from the problem examples above
4. **Constraints:** Must pass all example test cases from the problem statement

## Local Validation

After implementing your solution:

```bash
engine submit
```

**Important Note on Validation:**
- The local validator runs against example test cases extracted from the problem statement
- Passing local tests is **necessary but not sufficient** for full correctness
- For complete validation, submit your solution to {{ problem.url }}
- The Mastery Engine focuses on verifying you understand the pattern and can implement a working solution

## Learning Resources

These curated resources will help you understand the pattern deeply:

{% if resources %}
{% for resource in resources %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ resource }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
1. Review the problem description carefully
2. Think about the pattern and approach systematically
3. Test your solution with the provided examples

## Submission

Once your solution passes local tests:
```bash
engine submit
```
